tracing
Tracing the execution of a Prolog query allows you to see all of the goals that are executed as part of the query, 
in sequence, along with whether or not they succeed. Tracing also allows you to see what steps occur as Prolog backtracks.

To turn on tracing in Prolog, execute the "goal"
?- trace.
true.
